## **Secure E-Commerce Application**  
### **Overview**  
The Secure E-Commerce Application is a web-based platform that allows users to browse products, manage their carts, and make purchases. This project focuses on integrating modern web security best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities like **SQL injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and insecure session handling.

### **Features and Security Objectives**  

#### **Features**:  
1. **User Authentication**:  
   - Secure registration and login functionality.  
   - Role-based access for administrators and customers.  

2. **Product Management**:  
   - **Admin**: CRUD operations for products.  
   - **Customer**: Browse and add products to the cart.  

3. **Cart and Checkout**:  
   - Manage cart items.  
   - Place orders securely.  

4. **User Management**:  
   - **Admin**: View registered users.  

#### **Security Objectives**:  
- **SQL Injection Prevention**:  
   - Use of parameterized queries with SQLAlchemy.  

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mitigation**:  
   - Input validation on the backend.  
   - Angularâ€™s built-in sanitization.  

- **Session Management**:  
   - Secure cookies with HTTPOnly and Secure flags.  
   - CSRF protection using Flask-WTF.  

- **Input Validation**:  
   - Backend validation of user inputs to prevent malicious data.

### **Setup and Installation Instructions**  

#### **Prerequisites**:  
- Python 3.x  
- Node.js and npm (for Angular frontend)  
- Flask installed  

#### **Steps**:  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git  
   cd your-repo-name  
   ```  

2. Set up the Python environment:  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```  

3. Install Python dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

4. Set up the Angular frontend:  
   ```bash  
   cd frontend  
   npm install  
   ```  

5. Configure the application:  
   - Create a `.env` file based on the `config.py` structure to define the database URL and secret keys.  

6. Run the application:  
   ```bash  
   flask run  
   ```  

7. Launch the Angular frontend:  
   ```bash  
   cd frontend  
   ng serve  
   ```

### **Usage Guidelines**  

#### **Accessing the Application**:  
1. **Administrator**:  
   - Login to access product and user management tools.  
   - Add, update, or delete products through the admin dashboard.  

2. **Customer**:  
   - Register and login to browse products.  
   - Manage the shopping cart and place orders.  

#### **Important Notes**:  
- Ensure both the Flask backend and Angular frontend are running before interacting with the app.  
- Use only secure channels (HTTPS) in production environments.

### **Security Improvements**  

#### **SQL Injection Prevention**:  
- All database interactions use SQLAlchemy with parameterized queries.  

#### **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:  
- Implemented input validation on all user inputs.  
- Ensured Angular templates escape untrusted data.  

#### **Session Management**:  
- Secure cookies are used with the HTTPOnly and Secure flags.  
- CSRF tokens are validated on all sensitive operations.  

#### **Error Handling**:  
- Flask error pages mask internal information to prevent leakage of sensitive details.  

#### **Frontend Security**:  
- Angular handles client-side sanitization and disallows direct HTML injection unless explicitly trusted.
